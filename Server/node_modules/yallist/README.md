Yet Another Linked List

There are many doubly-linked list implementations like it, but this
one is mine.

For when an array would be too big, and a Map can't be iterated in
reverse order.


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isaacs/yallist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/isaacs/yallist) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/isaacs/yallist/badge.svg?service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/isaacs/yallist)

## basic usage

```javascript
var yallist = require('yallist')
var myList = yallist.create([1, 2, 3])
myList.push('foo')
myList.unshift('bar')
// of course pop() and shift() are there, too
console.log(myList.toArray()) // ['bar', 1, 2, 3, 'foo']
myList.forEach(function (k) {
  // walk the list head to tail
})
myList.forEachReverse(function (k, index, list) {
  // walk the list tail to head
})
var myDoubledList = myList.map(function (k) {
  return k + k
})
// now myDoubledList contains ['barbar', 2, 4, 6, 'foofoo']
// mapReverse is also a thing
var myDoubledListReverse =ngth.)

#### yallist.toArray()

Convert the list to an array.

#### yallist.forEach(fn, [thisp])

Call a function on each item in the list.

#### yallist.forEachReverse(fn, [thisp])

Call a function on each item in the list, in reverse order.

#### yallist.get(n)

Get the data at position `n` in the list.  If you use this a lot,
probably better off just using an Array.

#### yallist.getReverse(n)

Get the data at position `n`, counting from the tail.

#### yallist.map(fn, thisp)

Create a new Yallist with the result of calling the function on each
item.

#### yallist.mapReverse(fn, thisp)

Same as `map`, but in reverse.

#### yallist.pop()

Get the data from the list tail, and remove the tail from the list.

#### yallist.push(item, ...)

Insert one or more items to the tail of the list.

#### yallist.reduce(fn, initialValue)

Like Array.reduce.

#### yallist.reduceReverse

Like Array.reduce, but in reverse.

#### yallist.reverse

Reverse the list in place.

#### yallist.shift()

Get the data from the list head, and remove the head from the list.

#### yallist.slice([from], [to])

Just like Array.slice, but returns a new Yallist.

#### yallist.sliceReverse([from], [to])

Just like yallist.slice, but the result is returned in reverse.

#### yallist.toArray()

Create an array representation of the list.

#### yallist.toArrayReverse()

Create a reversed array representation of the list.

#### yallist.unshift(item, ...)

Insert one or more items to the head of the list.

#### yallist.unshiftNode(node)

Move a Node object to the front of the list.  (That is, pull it out of
wherever it lives, and make it the new head.)

If the node belongs to a different list, then that list will remove it
first.

#### yallist.pushNode(node)

Move a Node object to the end of the list.  (That is, pull it out of
wherever it lives, and make it the new tail.)

If the node belongs to a list already, then that list will remove it
first.

#### yallist.removeNode(node)

Remove a node from the list, preserving referential integrity of head
and tail and other nodes.

Will throw an error if you try to have a list remove a node that
doesn't belong to it.

### Yallist.Node

The class that holds the data and is actually the list.

Call with `var n = new Node(value, previousNode, nextNode)`

Note that if you do direct operations on Nodes themselves, it's very
easy to get into weird states where the list is broken.  Be careful :)

#### node.next

The next node in the list.

#### node.prev

The previous node in the list.

#### node.value

The data the node contains.

#### node.list

The list to which this node belongs.  (Null if it does not belong to
any list.)
