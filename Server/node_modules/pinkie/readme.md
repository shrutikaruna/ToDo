> Itty bitty little widdle twinkie pinkie [ES2015 Promise](https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-promise-objects) implementation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/floatdrop/pinkie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/floatdrop/pinkie)  [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/floatdrop/pinkie/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/floatdrop/pinkie?branch=master)

There are [tons of Promise implementations](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec/blob/master/implementations.md#standalone) out there, but all of them focus on browser compatibility and are often bloated with functionality.

This module is an exact Promise specification polyfill (like [native-promise-only](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only)), but in Node.js land (it should be browserify-able though).


## Install

```
$ npm install --save pinkie
```


## Usage

```jr rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.

#### pinkie.reject(reason)

Returns a Promise object that is rejected with the given `reason`.

#### pinkie.resolve(value)

Returns a Promise object that is resolved with the given `value`. If the `value` is a thenable (i.e. has a then method), the returned promise will "follow" that thenable, adopting its eventual state; otherwise the returned promise will be fulfilled with the `value`.
